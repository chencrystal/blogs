				<title>A few things about tasks, projects, organizations and smart folders you should know.</title>
				
					<dc:creator>Crystal Chen</dc:creator>
				        
				<description>Tasks, projects, organizations and smart folders make up the hierarchical structure of Quire. In this blog post, we will clarify what each of them is, and illustrate a few examples on how you can use them at will. A task is an actionable item to be done. It can be broken down into subtasks, sub-subtasks, and so on. But it can also be ideas, notes or sections that you want to jot down first and divide into smaller items later. Getting Started with Quire is one example of documentation...</description>

				<description>We made a few enhancements in our organization member roles. Both Normal+ and Normal members can add projects in an organization, and when they do, they become Admins of the projects. The only difference is that Normal members cannot access other projects that they are not members of. In summary, Admin, Normal+ and Limited+ members...</description>
