				<description>Quire’s “Shared Links” feature makes it super easy for you to collaborate with your clients.

Just like in our earlier blog post, simply call up Siri and tell her/him the task, the assignee and a due date and time, and it will be added directly to Quire. No need to open the app, or unlock your phone! And now with iOS 11, the conversation has become even more natural...</description>

				<title>A few things about tasks, projects, organizations and smart folders you should know.</title>
				
					<dc:creator>Crystal Chen</dc:creator>
				        
				<description>Tasks, projects, organizations and smart folders make up the hierarchical structure of Quire. In this blog post, we will clarify what each of them is, and illustrate a few examples on how you can use them at will. A task is an actionable item to be done. It can be broken down into subtasks, sub-subtasks, and so on. But it can also be ideas, notes or sections that you want to jot down first and divide into smaller items later. Getting Started with Quire is one example of documentation...</description>

To complete a task, swipe it from left to right and tap the complete icon...</description>

				<description>We made a few enhancements in our organization member roles. Both Normal+ and Normal members can add projects in an organization, and when they do, they become Admins of the projects. The only difference is that Normal members cannot access other projects that they are not members of. In summary, Admin, Normal+ and Limited+ members...</description>
