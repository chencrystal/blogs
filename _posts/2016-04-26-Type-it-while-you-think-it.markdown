Today, you’re bound to have a Q-shaped smile on your face, because we’ve got special productivity-boosting tips for everyone, especially those who’re addicted to keeping your hands on the keyboard! Now, you no longer need to switch between keyboard and mouse while adding and prepping your task.

So what are they? They’re *smart* keyboard shortcuts. They can help you add assignees, tags and due dates quickly, and more naturally in a single line.

## When you add a new task...

You may want to get David to write an article that’s related to design by May 2nd.

Simply add a task, and type “Write the article **@David #Design {5/2}**” and press Enter.

<div style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 128px; margin: 0 auto;">
{% markdown %}
![My helpful screenshot]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/{{page.imgDir}}/1.png)
{% endmarkdown %}
</div>

Your task would, of course, be automatically assigned to David, and a due date of May 2nd and the tag Design.

<div style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 77px; margin: 0 auto;">
{% markdown %}
![My helpful screenshot]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/{{page.imgDir}}/2.png)
{% endmarkdown %}
</div>

Obviously, when you type @, # or {}, you can use the Up or Down arrow key to select the assignee, tag or due date you want.

#### Note: You can see all the input date formats allowed [here](https://quire.io/w/Getting_Started_with_Quire/85/Auto-set_a_due_date).

## When you edit a task…

You may want to add or change the assignee, tag and due date of an existing task.

It’s like what you’d do when you’re adding a new task. For example, you can type “Write the article **@Kevin @Megan {+7d}**” and press Enter.

<div style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 124px; margin: 0 auto;">
{% markdown %}
![My helpful screenshot]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/{{page.imgDir}}/3.png)
{% endmarkdown %}
</div>

What happens is that this task would be assigned to both Kevin and Megan instead, and has a new due date of May 9th.

<div style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 76px; margin: 0 auto;">
{% markdown %}
![My helpful screenshot]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/{{page.imgDir}}/4.png)
{% endmarkdown %}
</div>

## Wait, there’s more!

There might be a couple extra useful shortcuts you’re not aware of.

To add a task, you can simply press **Ctrl+Enter**. You can even press **Tab** or **Shift+Tab** to make it a subtask (indent) or task (unindent) while you're typing the task name.

After you’ve added a task, you can still move it horizontally by pressing **Ctrl+Left** or **Ctrl+Right**. To move it vertically, press **Ctrl+Up** or **Ctrl+Down**.

To delete a task? Like you might have guessed, press **Ctrl+Delete**.

We’re bringing you the *smart* shortcuts because it’s natural that when you’re adding a task, you already have an idea who should do it, what priority it should have, and when it should be done. So, instead of choosing them after you add a task, you can now do them all together with **@**, **#** and **{}**.

There are also a whole other [shortcuts](https://quire.io/w/Getting_Started_with_Quire/11/Navigate_with_shortc...) in store you can check out!
