Humans are predominantly visual animals. We process visual information much better than we do non-visual ones. A lot of people manually add their tasks onto their Calendar once they are aware of the due dates so as to get a more visualized schedule. And it is for this reason, Quire has integrated with Google Calendar to help you do this automatically. Once you have imported a project and set a due date for a task, it will synchronize with your Google Calendar and have it displayed on the right date in a day’s time. You can then view visually which tasks are due this week or this month so you have a clear idea of what lies for you in the future.

> **How to import? So Easy!**

Simply follow 4 steps and you’ll have your tasks synced with your Google Calendar!

*Click on the Options icon that looks like a wheel.*

<div style="width: 700px; height: 441px; margin: 0 auto;">
{% markdown %}
![My helpful screenshot]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/{{page.imgDir}}/1.png)
{% endmarkdown %}
</div>

*Choose Sync to calendar.*

<div style="width: 700px; height: 440px; margin: 0 auto;">
{% markdown %}
![My helpful screenshot]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/{{page.imgDir}}/2.png)
{% endmarkdown %}
</div>

*Follow the 4 steps. You can uncheck the box to see all tasks.*

<div style="width: 700px; height: 444px; margin: 0 auto;">
{% markdown %}

{% endmarkdown %}
</div>

*Syncs automatically in a day if not right away:*

<div style="width: 545px; height: 424px; margin: 0 auto;">
{% markdown %}

{% endmarkdown %}
</div>

Hope you find this feature useful and enjoy Quire even more!
