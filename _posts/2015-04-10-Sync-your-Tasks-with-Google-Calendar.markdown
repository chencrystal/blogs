Humans are predominantly visual animals. We process visual information much better than we do non-visual ones. A lot of people manually add their tasks onto their Calendar once they are aware of the due dates so as to get a more visualized schedule. And it is for this reason, Quire has integrated with Google Calendar to help you do this automatically. Once you have imported a project and set a due date for a task, it will synchronize with your Google Calendar and have it displayed on the right date in a day’s time. You can then view visually which tasks are due this week or this month so you have a clear idea of what lies for you in the future.

> **How to import? So Easy!**

Simply follow 4 steps and you’ll have your tasks synced with your Google Calendar!

### 1. Go to project's Settings -> Options -> Integrations

<div style="max-width: 219px; max-height: 96px; margin: 0 auto;">
{% markdown %}

{% endmarkdown %}
</div>

### 2. Click on "Sync" under Calendar

<div style="max-width: 473px; max-height: 152px; margin: 0 auto;">
{% markdown %}

{% endmarkdown %}
</div>

#### Tip: You can click on the arrow beside the project name at the top and choose Integrate Calendars directly.

### 3. Choose what kind of tasks you want to sync

<div style="max-width: 454px; max-height: 207px; margin: 0 auto;">
{% markdown %}

{% endmarkdown %}
</div>

### 4. Choose Google Calendar if it is not already set by default

<div style="max-width: 455px; max-height: 207px; margin: 0 auto;">
{% markdown %}
![My helpful screenshot]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/{{page.imgDir}}/4.png)
{% endmarkdown %}
</div>

### 5. Follow the steps specificed in the description

<div style="max-width: 453px; max-height: 184px; margin: 0 auto;">
{% markdown %}
![My helpful screenshot]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/{{page.imgDir}}/5.png)
{% endmarkdown %}
</div>

Syncs automatically in a day if not right away!
