Your smart assistant Siri just got smarter with iOS 11 for you in Quire.

Just like in our earlier [blog post](http://127.0.0.1:4000/blog/p/Quire-Siri-Best-Task-Manager-Friend.html), simply call up Siri and tell her/him the task, the assignee and a due date and time, and it will be added directly to Quire. No need to open the app, or unclick your phone!

And now with iOS 11, the conversation has become even more natural.

Check out the demo video:

First, you need to set Siri up with iOS 11.

1. Tap **Settings** on your iPhone home screen
2. Tap **Siri & Search**
3. Scroll down until you see **Quire** and tap on it
4. Enable **Use with Siri**

Now, Siri is ready to interact with Quire.

Here are what you say to start the conversation:

* Add task in Quire
* Add a task in Quire
* Add [task name] in Quire

#### Tip: If they do not work, uninstall and install the Quire iOS app and try again.<p>

<div style="max-width: 300px; max-height: 532px; margin: 0 auto;">
{% markdown %}
![My helpful screenshot]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/{{page.imgDir}}/1.jpeg)
{% endmarkdown %}
</div>

Next, you can say the project name, then the task name.

For example:

* Write the article
* Publish the article by 5 PM next Friday and assign to Crystal

<div style="max-width: 300px; max-height: 532px; margin: 0 auto;">
{% markdown %}
![My helpful screenshot]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/{{page.imgDir}}/2.jpeg)
{% endmarkdown %}
</div>

That’s it.

Siri will add the task to your Quire project.

<div style="max-width: 300px; max-height: 532px; margin: 0 auto;">
{% markdown %}
![My helpful screenshot]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/{{page.imgDir}}/3.jpeg)
{% endmarkdown %}
</div>

Your conversation with Siri has ended.
 
When you go to your project in Quire, this is what you will see:

<div style="max-width: 300px; max-height: 532px; margin: 0 auto;">
{% markdown %}
![My helpful screenshot]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/{{page.imgDir}}/4.jpeg)
{% endmarkdown %}
</div>

#### Note: “Send a message on Quire” works for versions before iOS 11.<p><br>

If you speak in German, here are what you can say to start the conversation:

* Aufgabe in Quire einfügen
* Eine Aufgabe in Quire einfügen
* Füge die Aufgabe [task name] in Quire ein

Here is a demo video in German:
