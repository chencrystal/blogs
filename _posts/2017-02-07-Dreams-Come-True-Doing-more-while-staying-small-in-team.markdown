For many of us, the biggest challenge is to stay productive and organized as our team grows bigger and bigger. But it is the opposite for Ray.

Ray works as a senior software engineer in [Aerovironment, Inc.](https://www.avinc.com/), a technology company located in California, United States. For him, the question is how to get more things done in a team that shrinked from 12 to 4-5 people.

I spoke to Ray about how Quire has helped him stay away from chaos and pressure. Here is the interview in a nutshell.

## How did you find out about Quire?

Years ago, I used to use a PIM software called [ECCO Pro](http://eccopro.com/). The thing I liked about it was that it allowed you to set up hierarchical to-do lists which is exactly how I think about my work. It seemed no other software did that at the time.

Unfortunately, the company went out of business. So I did a search to find a “**hierarchical todo list**” software, and [Quire](https://quire.io/) was what I found.

## Was there any problem or challenge before you started using Quire?

Yes, there definitely was.

As our team got smaller, I found myself having to manage many projects at the same time, and trying to remember where I was in each one.

It was very difficult to stay organized, when your to-do list kept growing.

## Mind telling us how has Quire helped you then?

I have been using Quire now for about 2 months now. It has helped me a great deal.

For example, it has helped me to **prioritize my work and remember where I am in projects that I have to move away from and come back to**. It has also helped me discipline myself to write things down, so I don’t feel stressed trying to keep everything in my head.

I use the tree structure to indicate dependencies - subtasks must be completed before their parent task is done.

## Lastly, anything you would like to say to the Quire team?

Recently, I have begun adding tasks for my team members, inviting them to join Quire and asking them to check off tasks after completing them.

I believe eventually, Quire might just become the perfect team coordination tool - what it is especially designed to be - for us.
