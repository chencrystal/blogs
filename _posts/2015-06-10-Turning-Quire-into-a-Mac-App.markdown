Some of you may not know Fluid. It is a simple tool that can make a website or a web application like Gmail, Facebook, and of course Quire, into a desktop application on your Mac. This way, it will save you the trouble of running each of these web apps in a separate tab in your browser.

### Here is how you will do it:

*First, go to the website and click on Free Download.*

<div style="width: 600px; height: 621px; margin: 0 auto;">
{% markdown %}
![My helpful screenshot]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/{{page.imgDir}}/1.png)
{% endmarkdown %}
</div>

---

*Once it is downloaded to your computer, click on the Download folder to open the Fluid app.*

<div style="width: 600px; height: 454px; margin: 0 auto;">
{% markdown %}
![My helpful screenshot]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/{{page.imgDir}}/2.png)
{% endmarkdown %}
</div>

---

*Follow the instructions to create a Fluid app.*

<div style="width: 557px; height: 322px; margin: 0 auto;">
{% markdown %}
![My helpful screenshot]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/{{page.imgDir}}/3.png)
{% endmarkdown %}
</div>

---

*Then you’ll see the app you have just created appear on the Dock!*

<div style="width: 600px; height: 441px; margin: 0 auto;">
{% markdown %}
![My helpful screenshot]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/{{page.imgDir}}/4.png)
{% endmarkdown %}
</div>
