Honestly. How many times have you ditched your ideas?

Or, gone through the trouble of drawing them on a napkin or sketching them on a meeting board, and then simply forgetting where to look or losing them completely on the next day, just to name a few?

We’re proud to present to you [Quire app on iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1095193897)!

It’s amazing to have a big goal or dream. However, they can be challenging to accomplish in a dynamic world. Whatever you need to realize it, Quire is there to help!

## Tackle Big Goal with Small Steps
Break it down into as small a step as you need. That’s how our minds naturally work. No matter how challenging your goal is, Quire lets you map out your thoughts.

## Turn Growing Plan into Minimal To-dos
Pick out a few tasks at a time. That’s how we drive inspirations forward. Instead of being buried in a long list of to-dos, Quire lets you keep it rolling without losing the big picture.

## Do Less, Accomplish More with Your Team
Keep everyone engaged in real-time collaboration. Quire lets you work seamlessly with your team across all of your devices, anytime, anywhere, online or offline. Even remotely, such a harmonious team succeeds together.
